Battleships in Python
====================
####Life after Makers series

After twelve weeks of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), I'm starting learning Python.
This first repository in Python is just part of a challenge on [Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com)

###What is it?
Simplified version of Battleship, only one player at the time, the ships are placed random by the computer.
The player has 4 turns to sink the ship.

###How do you use it?
`git clone https://github.com/mserino/Battleships_Python.git`

`cd battleships_python`

`python battleships.py`

And play!

###What's missing?
- Tests are still missing (not covered yet)
- Would like to add multiplayer and more than one ship
- Would like to let the player choose the position of the ships
